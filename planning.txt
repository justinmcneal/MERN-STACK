PLANNING TASKS

Goals: Define scope, project structure, and initial designs.

Define Project Scope & Requirements

Select 3 data source: 

* CoinGecko → can fully cover price monitoring.
* Etherscan family → can cover gas fees.
* CryptoCompare → can cover historical data (for ML scoring).

Select top 5 tokens for MVP monitoring.

* ETH → Native gas token on Ethereum, widely paired.
* USDT (Tether) → Most popular stablecoin, high liquidity everywhere.
* USDC (USD Coin) → Second major stablecoin, often paired with ETH/BNB.
* BNB → Native to Binance Smart Chain, good for cross-chain arbitrage with ETH.
* MATIC → Native to Polygon, ensures you test multi-chain behavior.

List core MVP Features (Ito ung goal natin at the end of the project)

* Price Monitoring → Call CoinGecko API for the 5 tokens, store results in DB, show on dashboard.
* Arbitrage Detection → Compare token prices across chains, calculate spreads.
* Opportunity Scoring → Lightweight ML (or even a heuristic in MVP: e.g., profit % − gas fee).
* Dashboard → UI with tables, charts, and filters to visualize data.
* User Authentication → Basic signup/login (can even be optional).
* Profile → Let users pick tracked tokens, set alert thresholds.
