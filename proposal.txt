1. Project Title
● Title: Cross-Chain Arbitrage Intelligence: An LLM–Powered Arbitrage Insights Platform

2. Project Description
Summary:
This project aims to build a web-based platform that monitors token prices across multiple blockchains to identify profitable arbitrage opportunities. By leveraging blockchain APIs and a lightweight machine learning model, the platform will provide users with a dashboard displaying potential cross-chain trades, profit estimates, and gas cost considerations. This system is intended for crypto traders and DeFi enthusiasts seeking to identify high-potential arbitrage opportunities efficiently.
Scope:
Web Application:


Authentication
Dashboard visualization 
Price Monitoring
Arbitrage detection logic that calculates potential profits after gas fees 
User-friendly interface to track opportunities and historical trends
Alerts



3. Objectives
Develop a web-based dashboard for monitoring token prices across multiple blockchains.
Detect potential arbitrage opportunities and calculate estimated profits.
Implement a lightweight model for scoring the most promising opportunities.
Ensure real-time updates and visualizations of arbitrage data.
Provide an intuitive interface for crypto traders to explore cross-chain trading options.

4. Target Users
Crypto Traders seeking arbitrage opportunities across chains.
DeFi enthusiasts are interested in monitoring token prices and network conditions.
Portfolio managers and small-scale investors are looking to optimize returns.

5. System Features
Authentication: Optional user authentication for tracking personal preferences.
Real-Time Price Monitoring: Fetch token prices via APIs across 3 APIs
Arbitrage Detection: Calculate potential cross-chain profit after gas fees.
Opportunity Scoring: LLM based ranking of arbitrage opportunities based on historical trends and estimated ROI.
Dashboard Visualizations: Interactive charts for token prices, arbitrage potential, and historical performance.
User Profile: update user informations
Alerts: Optional alerts when high-value opportunities appear.

6. Technologies and Tools
Technical Stack Justification:
 The selected tech stack focuses on speed of development, real-time data integration, and web accessibility for users.
Frontend: React.js for UI development.
Backend: Node.js + Express for API handling, efficient data fetching, and integration with ML scoring.
Database: MongoDB for storing historical prices, opportunities, and optional user preferences due to its flexibility with semi-structured data.
Model: to check what model is suitable for this
Version Control: GitHub for source code management, collaboration, and version tracking.

7. Designing Tools
Figma: For prototyping the dashboard layout and user interface.
Postman: For API testing during backend development.
VS Code: For full-stack development, including React frontend, Node.js backend, and Python ML scripts.
