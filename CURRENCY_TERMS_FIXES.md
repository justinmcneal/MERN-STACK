# Currency Conversion & Terms Modal Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Opportunities Page Not Converting Currency

**Problem:** Changing currency in Settings didn't update profit displays on Opportunities page

**Root Cause:** `useCurrencyFormatter()` hook was being called without passing the user's selected currency preference, so it always defaulted to USD

**Solution Implemented:**

**File:** `client/src/pages/opportunities.tsx`

```typescript
// BEFORE (DEFAULT TO USD):
const { formatCurrency } = useCurrencyFormatter();

// AFTER (USE USER PREFERENCE):
const currencyPreference = (preferences?.currency ?? 'USD') as SupportedCurrency;
const { formatCurrency } = useCurrencyFormatter(currencyPreference);
```

**How It Works:**
1. Gets user's currency preference from `usePreferences()` hook
2. Defaults to 'USD' if no preference is set
3. Passes the currency to `useCurrencyFormatter()` 
4. Formatter then converts all USD amounts to selected currency
5. Dependency array includes `formatCurrency` so updates when currency changes

**Test It:**
1. Go to Settings → Change currency to EUR, GBP, JPY, or PHP
2. Navigate to Opportunities page
3. Verify profit amounts show with correct currency:
   - EUR: €
   - GBP: £
   - JPY: ¥
   - PHP: ₱
4. Amount should be converted (not just symbol changed)

**Example:**
```
If profit is $100 USD and user selects EUR:
- Shows: €92 (automatically converted at ~0.92 rate)
- NOT: $100 with wrong symbol
```

### 2. ✅ Terms Agreement Modal - Missing Confirmation Button

**Problem:** After clicking Terms/Privacy links in the modal and scrolling through them, there was no button inside the modal to confirm you've read them

**Root Cause:** The LegalModal component only had a close (X) button in the header, but no footer confirmation button

**Solution Implemented:**

**File:** `client/src/components/ui/LegalModal/LegalModal.tsx`

Added a footer with "I've Read This" button:

```typescript
{/* Footer - Added button to confirm reading */}
<div className="border-t border-slate-700/50 p-6 bg-slate-950/50 flex justify-end gap-3">
  <button
    onClick={onClose}
    className="px-6 py-2 bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-cyan-600 hover:from-cyan-400 hover:to-cyan-500 text-white rounded-lg transition-all duration-200 font-medium"
  >
    I&apos;ve Read This
  </button>
</div>
```

**How the Flow Works Now:**

1. **In Register Form:**
   - See checkbox: "I have read and understand the Terms of Service"
   - See checkbox: "I have read and understand the Privacy Policy"
   - Click checkbox → Opens modal

2. **In Terms/Privacy Modal:**
   - Read the full content (scrollable)
   - See bottom button: "I've Read This"
   - Click button to close and mark as read

3. **Back in Terms Agreement Modal:**
   - Checkbox is now checked ✓
   - Can now check the "I agree to..." checkbox
   - Click "Agree" to complete registration

**Test It:**
```
1. Go to Register page
2. Click "Review & Accept Terms" button
3. In modal, click "Terms of Service" link
4. Read the terms (scroll through)
5. Click "I've Read This" button at bottom
6. Back in main modal, "I have read..." checkbox is checked ✓
7. Repeat for Privacy Policy
8. Check "I agree..." checkbox
9. Click "Agree" button to accept and close
10. Form shows: "You have agreed to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy" ✓
```

## Currency Conversion Details

### Supported Currencies:
- **USD** - $ (Dollar)
- **EUR** - € (Euro) ~0.92x
- **GBP** - £ (Pound) ~0.79x
- **JPY** - ¥ (Yen) ~155x
- **PHP** - ₱ (Peso) ~57x

### How Conversion Works:
1. All profits stored in database as USD
2. Formatter fetches exchange rates (cached 12 hours)
3. Multiplies USD amount by exchange rate
4. Displays with correct symbol and converted value

### Example Calculations:
```
Opportunity: $100 USD profit

EUR: $100 × 0.92 = €92
GBP: $100 × 0.79 = £79
JPY: $100 × 155 = ¥15,500
PHP: $100 × 57 = ₱5,700
```
